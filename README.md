# Color Pages Project

The home page has a list of colours. If you click on one of them, you'll be taken to that colour's page, where you can see what the colour looks like. It is a Next.js project, which dynamically generates the pages for each colour using Static Site Generation (SSG). Tailwind is used for the styling.


## Project features
